          "question": "What is touch typing?",
          "answer": "Touch typing is a method of typing where you use all ten fingers without looking at the keyboard. Your fingers learn the position of each key through muscle memory, allowing you to type faster and more accurately while focusing on the screen."

          "question": "How long does it take to learn touch typing?",

        "whatIsWpm": {
          "question": "What is WPM and what is a good typing speed?",
          "answer": "WPM stands for Words Per Minute, the standard measure of typing speed. Average typing speed is 40 WPM, while professional typists often reach 65-75 WPM. With practice, you can achieve 80-100+ WPM."
        },
        "whatIsHomeRow": {
