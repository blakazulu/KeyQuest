      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "items": {
        "whatIsTouchTyping": {
          "question": "What is touch typing?",
          "answer": "Touch typing is a method of typing where you use all ten fingers without looking at the keyboard. Your fingers learn the position of each key through muscle memory, allowing you to type faster and more accurately while focusing on the screen."
        },
        "howLongToLearn": {
          "question": "How long does it take to learn touch typing?",
          "answer": "Most people can learn the basics of touch typing in 2-4 weeks with regular practice of 15-30 minutes per day. Achieving fluency and speed typically takes 1-3 months of consistent practice."
        },
        "whatIsWpm": {
          "question": "What is WPM and what is a good typing speed?",
          "answer": "WPM stands for Words Per Minute, the standard measure of typing speed. Average typing speed is 40 WPM, while professional typists often reach 65-75 WPM. With practice, you can achieve 80-100+ WPM."
        },
        "whatIsHomeRow": {
          "question": "What is the home row in typing?",
          "answer": "The home row is the middle row of letter keys on your keyboard (ASDF for your left hand and JKL; for your right hand). Your fingers should rest on these keys and return to them after pressing other keys. The F and J keys have small bumps to help you find them without looking."
        },
        "isFree": {
          "question": "Is KeyQuest free to use?",
          "answer": "Yes! KeyQuest is completely free. You can access all lessons, practice modes, and track your progress without any cost or registration required."
